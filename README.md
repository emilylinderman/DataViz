# DataViz
My name is Emily Linderman. I am a sophomore studying Journalism at [**Lehigh University**](http://www1.lehigh.edu/insidelehigh) with a minor in Spanish. I am an assistant Lifestyle editor for Lehigh's biweekly, student-run newspaper [**The Brown and White**](http://thebrownandwhite.com/). I also work at Lehigh in the Development Office as a Donor Relations Assistant and as a Head Liner at Lehigh Liners. In the Bethlehem community, I am a volunteer Young Life leader at Liberty High School. 
I am using GitHub for a Data Visualization course I am taking this semester. I am excited to get to understand some fundamental coding and learn a new skillset that will be important in my future career as a journalist.
